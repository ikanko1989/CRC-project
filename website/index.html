        Worked on Ericsson NFVI solution as a Release Verification and Feature Development member. <br />
        Ericsson NFVI solution has been the foundation of Ericsson Cloud Infrastructure for several years and continues
        to
        play a key role in cloud native deployments involving for example 5G Core.
        Ericsson NFVI enables operators to deploy virtual network functions (VNFs) or cloud native functions (CNFs) from
        multiple vendors,
        as well as OSS and BSS applications, with speed while keeping total cost of ownership low. The solution is
        system-verified which means we
        take full life cycle management responsibility including hardware and software components significantly
        simplifying deployment, operations and upgrades.
